This page is a place for me to share some of the more creative aspects of my work - grounded in photography.

"Spectrography" is a mash-up of two of my loves: spectrocopy and photography! When I am not capturing and analyzing the light reflected off of our favorite plants, you can find me outside romping around with my camera and binoculars. From awesome avian finds to friends fiending over cool outdoor adventures, if I'm not capturing the joy with my field spectrometer, I have my camera! 

This page is also a nod to the *Bavarian Pigeon Corps*, an awesome piece of remote sensing history. In 1907, Dr. Julius Neubronner developped the pigeon camera. This camera, when strapped to his own little group of homing pigeons, took some of the first arial photography of earth. A precursor to our modern day drones outfitted with sensors of all kinds. It started with a pigeon with a camera! 

So here is my modern day version of the Bavarian Pigeon Corps: a grad student running around outside with her fieldspec and camera!
